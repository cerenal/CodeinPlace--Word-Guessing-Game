    * With the "get_word" function, we choose a random word from the txt file.
    * In the main function, we give the secret_word as a value to the play_game function.
    * In the play_game function, we assign the initial_guess number to the "ig" variable. The "ig" variable will control the remaining right in the code.
    * We are adding the secret-word to the list. We assign this list length to the variable "i".
    With the *for loop, I put a hyphen as long as the word "secret_word" in a second list.

* We ask the user to make their first guess.
*Each prediction is checked for letters with the "control" function.
*If it is a letter, it is converted to uppercase in this function.
